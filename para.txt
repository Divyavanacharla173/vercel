Fitness is the body's ability to perform daily tasks, sports, and occupational work with optimal performance, endurance, and strength, often achieved through proper nutrition, consistent exercise, and adequate rest. It enhances physical health by improving heart and lung function, boosting the immune system, and managing weight, while also benefiting mental health by reducing stress and improving cognitive function.
